has-many-with-set 1.1.0

- Children can now see their parents.
- The README now uses Ruby 1.9 features.
- Fixed a bug with the relationships table. By default, Rails name has_and_belongs_to_many relationship tables in alphabetical order. This breaks the save callback if your parent > child.
- Added CHANGELOG.
